# Housing-Solutins-with-Blockchain-and-IoT
The project aims to create a trustless automated renting system with control of home services utilities tied to renting agreement. Essentially, home automation can be linked with your rent agreement and status of IoT devices (working or not) will be directly affected by the whether the rent has been paid or not.
